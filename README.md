# HomeFlix Cyber Node

## Cloudflare deployment

This repository includes `wrangler.jsonc` configured to publish the static website from `www/`, keeping Electron, Android, scripts, and installed dependencies out of the Cloudflare asset upload.

In Cloudflare's build settings, use:

- **Build command:** leave empty
- **Deploy command:** `npx wrangler deploy`

The current website entry point is `index.html` at the repository root. Before deploying after website edits, sync it to the Cloudflare asset directory:

```bash
cp index.html www/index.html
mkdir -p www/build
cp build/homeflix-icon.svg www/build/homeflix-icon.svg
npx wrangler deploy
```

For local deployments, run `npm run deploy:cloudflare` after syncing the files above. Wrangler must be authenticated to the intended Cloudflare account.
